# dual-pdf
Dual PDF-viewer synchronizing two PDFs in two browser windows for coop with LaTeX beamer package

Work in progress.

Current short demo:

# Install node on your machine
# Download and unzip this project
# cd into the directory
# node server.js
# browser to localhost:8125/docent.html
# The page will want to open a popup - so allow that popup (and, maybe, reload)
# Move the opened popup window ("beamer.html") to second screen
# Mouseclick into the first window (docent)
# Navigate with left and right cursor keys

The basic idea is to get a dual pdf support for the latex beamer package running which, in difference to existing state of the art
# works in every browser
# does not require linux, python or whatever the other solutions require
# works also when the two windows (main and second screen) have different resolution

Currentt status:
# Only proof of concept with fixed pdf slides

Forthcoming as soon as I have time (LOL)
# beamer support files
# more doc
# chose your pdf file
# integrate with browser based LaTeX build environment from one of my other projects
