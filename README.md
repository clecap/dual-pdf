# dual-pdf
Dual-pdf viewer is a browser-based PDF viewer for viewing PDF together with a number of embedded elements such as audio, video, html, svg, animations, speaker-notes, elearning widgets and more. 

Currently heavy refactoring is going on. The present state of the repository is hopelessly not up to date. This will be fixed. Until then, there is this placeholder ;-)
